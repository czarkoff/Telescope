A basic [Gemini]("https://geminiprotocol.net/") desktop browser.

At this stage *Telescope* is very-very bare bones.
You basically can navigate around Gemini space to a certain degree,  but with a lot of rough edges.
Even the most common functionality that one expects from a browser is currently missing,  such as:

* Redirects
* Authentication and basic security
* UI polish
* Error handling

# Roadmap

* [X] Render content pages.
* [X] Support navigation over links.
* [ ] Achieve Gemini protocol compliance.
* [ ] Support browser history.
* [ ] Support TOFU (that is, present all new certificates to the user and pin them when the user accepts them).
* [ ] Tabbed UI.
* [ ] Allow customizing the presentation.

With this being one of my weekend projects,  I would not recommend to hold your breath for the release.

# Contributing

Not expected at the moment.
Not that contributions are not welcome,  but with the current state of this browser your time is spent better contributing to other projects.
